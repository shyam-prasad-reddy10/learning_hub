      <p>
        PostgreSQL was invented at the Berkeley Computer Science Department, University of California.
      </p>
      <p>
        It started as a project in 1986 with the goal of creating a database system with the minimal features needed to support multiple data types.

        In the beginning, PostgreSQL ran on UNIX platforms, but now it can run on various platforms, including Windows and MacOS.
